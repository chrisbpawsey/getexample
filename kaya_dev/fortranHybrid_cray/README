# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate hybrid_hello.f90 example
# on Magnus on Cray Environment. This is a mixed-mode job
# cp the hybrid_hello.f90 source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hybrid_hello.f90 .


#  which includes both MPI and OpenMP jobs.
# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks,
# the number of MPI tasks per node,
# the number of MPI tasks per socket, and
# the number of threads for each MPI task. 
# This information is located under hello_hybrid_cray.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_hybrid_cray.slurm &


# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 2 nodes (--nodes=2)
# Then, we set the total number of threads to 6
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 8 MPI tasks (-n 8)
# with 4 MPI tasks per node (-N 4),
# with 2 MPI tasks per socket or NUMA region (-S 2)
# and each MPI tasks have 6 threads. (-d 6)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like:
# aprun -n 8 -N 4 -S 2 -d 6 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hybrid_hello.f90 code on Cray
ftn -O2 -h omp hybrid_hello.f90 -o hello_hybrid_cray

# To submit the job to Magnus
