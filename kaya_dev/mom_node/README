# Example OBJECTIVE:  to demonstrate the difference between 
# the mom nodes and compute nodes on magnus.
# We use the hostname command to show what nodes on the system the 
# hostname commands is actually executed on.

# To run this example just submit a job to magnus using the 
# hostname.slurm script 

#export SBATCH_ACCOUNT=`echo $MYGROUP | awk 'BEGIN{FS="/"}{print $3}'`

sbatch hostname.slurm

echo "The sbatch command returns what your jobid is for this job"

echo " squeue -u $USER "
echo " " 
echo "This job will be run in ${MYSCRATCH}/run_hostname/"
echo "The results from this job are moved to ${MYGROUP}/hostname_results/"
echo " "
echo "To view the results change to the ${MYGROUP}/hostname_results directory"
echo "cd ${MYGROUP}/hostname_results"

echo "the change into the jobid directory and use cat command to inspect the "
echo "hostname.log file!" 
echo "cd 44444444"
