# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate hybrid_hello.f90 example
# with thread placement on Magnus on the GNU environment. 
# cp the hybrid_hello.f90 source code

# This is a hybrid MPI/OpenMP job where we run 24 MPI tasks
# with 2 OpenMP threads per MPI task.
# To run this code, we need to specify the number of MPI tasks,
# the number of MPI tasks per node,
# the number of threads per each task which are also 
# the hyper-threads per core.
# This information is located under thread_placement_gnu.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs thread_placement_gnu.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--node=1)
# To compile the code on the GNU environment, we swap
# from Cray to GNU as shown below:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu 
# Then, we set the total number of threads to 2
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 24 MPI tasks (-n 24)
# with 24 MPI tasks on each node (-N 24).
# with 2 threads for each task (-d 2)
# and these are hyper-threads per core (-j 2).
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like:
# aprun -n 24 -N 24 -d 2 -j 2 ./$EXECUTABLE  >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hybrid_hello.f90 code on GNU
ftn -O2 -fopenmp hybrid_hello.f90 -o thread_placement_gnu
