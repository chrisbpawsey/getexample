#
# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate hello_mpi.f90 example 
# on Magnus on Cray environment.
# hello_mpi.f90 code is taken from
# https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/hello_mpi/hello_mpi.f90
# cp the hello_mpi.f90 source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hello_mpi.f90 .


# hello_mpi.f90 is an MPI code that runs on 2 nodes 
# with 24 MPI tasks on each node.
# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks
# and the number of MPI tasks per node.
# This information is located under hello_mpi_cray.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_mpi_cray.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 2 nodes (--nodes=2)
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 48 MPI tasks (-n 48)
# with 24 tasks per node (-N 24)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like:
# aprun -n 48 -N 24 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_mpi.f90 code on Cray
ftn -O2 hello_mpi.f90 -o hello_mpi_cray

# To submit the job to Magnus
sbatch hello_mpi_cray.slurm
jobid=`squeue -u $USER | grep $USER | awk '{print $1}'`
