#
# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate omp_hello.c example on Magnus
# on the Intel environment. omp_hello.c is an OpenMP code 
# and restricted to a single node.
# omp_hello.c is taken from 
# https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/exercise.html
# cp the omp_hello.c source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/omp_hello.c .


# To run this code, we need to specify the number of tasks
# and the number of OpenMP threads.
# This information is located under hello_omp_intel.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_omp_intel.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--nodes=1)
# To compile the code with Intel, we swap from Cray
# environment to Intel as shown below:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel
# Then, we set the total number of threads to 24 as shown below:
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
# To run with multiple threads on Cray with the Intel environment, 
# we need to disable AFFINITY as shown:
# export KMP=AFFINITY=disabled 
# If it is not disabled, the code runs on only one thread.
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 1 OpenMP task (-n 1)
# with 24 threads (-d 24)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like: 
# aprun -n 1 -d 24 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the omp_hello.c code with Intel
cc -O2 -openmp omp_hello.c -o hello_omp_intel

# To submit the job to Magnus
