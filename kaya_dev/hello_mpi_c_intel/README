#
# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate hello_mpi.c example on Magnus
# with Intel Environment.
# hello_mpi.c code is taken from
# https://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/classes/intro_mpi/hello_world_ex.html
# cp the hello_mpi.c source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hello_mpi.c .


# hello_mpi.c is an MPI code that runs on 2 nodes 
# with 24 MPI tasks on each node.
# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks
# and the number of MPI tasks per node.
# We also need to change the compiler from Cray to Intel
# to be able to run this code with Intel Environment.
# This information is located under hello_mpi_intel.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_mpi_intel.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 2 nodes (--nodes=2)
# To compile hello_mpi.c with Intel, we change the compiler
# from Cray to Intel as shown below:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 48 MPI tasks (-n 48)
# with 24 tasks per node (-N 24)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like:
# aprun -n 48 -N 24 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_mpi.c code with Intel
cc -O2 hello_mpi.c -o hello_mpi_intel

# To submit the job to Magnus
sbatch hello_mpi_intel.slurm
