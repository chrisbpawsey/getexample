# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate hello_mpi.f90 example
# on Magnus on the GNU environment with task placement.
# hello_mpi.f90 is an MPI code that runs with hyper-threading 
# which helps specifying how tasks bind to logical cores.
# hello_mpi.f90 code is taken from
# https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/hello_mpi/hello_mpi.f90
# cp the hello_mpi.f90 source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hello_mpi.f90 .


# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks,
# the number of MPI tasks per node
# and the number of hyper threads per core.
# This information is located under task_placement_gnu.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs task_placement_gnu.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--nodes=1)
# To compile the code with GNU environment, we swap from
# Cray to GNU as shown below:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 48 MPI tasks (-n 48)
# with 48 tasks required on the node (-N 48)
# These tasks are accomodated using hyper-threading with
# two (hyper-) threads per core (-j 2).
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like: 
# aprun -n 48 -N 48 -j 2 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_mpi.f90 code on GNU
ftn -O2 hello_mpi.f90 -o task_placement_gnu

# To submit the job to Magnus
