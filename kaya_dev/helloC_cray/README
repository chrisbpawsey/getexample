# This is the README file is an executable script.
# To run type: ./README
#
# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate helloworld.c example 
# in Cray environment on Magnus.
# helloworld.c is a simple c code that prints "Hello World!" 
# and runs on a single node.
# cp the helloworld.c source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/helloworld.c .


# To run this code, we need to specify the number of nodes used.
# This information is located under helloworld_cray.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs helloworld_cray.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--nodes=1)
# To run the code, we simply type:
# aprun -n 1 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the helloworld.c code on Cray
cc -O2 helloworld.c -o helloworld_cray

# To submit the job to Magnus
sbatch helloworld_cray.slurm
