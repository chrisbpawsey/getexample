# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate hello_world.f90 example 
# in Cray environment on Magnus.
# hello_world.f90 is a serial FORTRAN code and 
# It prints "Hello World!" and runs on a single node.
# cp the hello_world.f90 source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hello_world.f90 .


# To run this code, we need to specify the number of nodes used.
# This information is located under hello_fortran_cray.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_fortran_cray.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--nodes=1)
# To run the code, we simply type:
# aprun -n 1 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_world.f90 code
ftn -O2 hello_world.f90 -o hello_fortran_cray

# To submit the job to Magnus
sbatch hello_fortran_cray.slurm
